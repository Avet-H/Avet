# Data Analysis Portfolio 

Hi! My name is Avetik Mnatsakanyan and with this webpage, I'm presenting to you some of my technical skills. With a solid academic background in economics, econometrics, and statistics I have more than 5 years of experience in data analysis, data management, data cleaning and visualization, survey design, and data modeling.  

### Power BI projects 
The projects listed in this section are developed using Power BI desktop (click on title to access .pbix files in GitHub) 

#### 1. *Contoso_DAXexamples* - Data Analytics Expression is a powerful tool that can be used to generate more complex measures and calculated column for dynamic vizualizations. This project is developed using the "Contoso" sample data provided by microsoft and shows some of commonly used calculations with DAX.

#### 2. *Billionaire*- I've always been curious about wealth distribution across countries, industries, companies and even individuals. Here are some descriptive graphs and indicators that I developed based on the data published by Forbes about Billionaires at the end of 2022. In the same file, you can find a page report presenting GDP data from 2021 according to WorldBank data and compare those numbers to get an interesting insight. Apparently, if we sort countries by their GDP in ascending order and combine the GDPs of the first 165 countries we will get about $11.5 trillion which is approximately the same amount as 2490 billionaires' net worth together!

#### 3. *NBA visuals*-Using some historical data from NBA I created the interesting vizual about shots and distances in 2010 - 2018 period.
