### Hi !!! 
My name is Avetik Mnatsakanyan and this webpage intends to present you some of my technical skills. With solid academic background in economics, econometrics, and statistics I have more than 5 years experience in data analysis, data management, data cleaning and visualization, survey design and data modelling.  

### Power BI projects 
The projects listed in this section are developed using Power BI desktop (click on title to access .pbix files in GitHub) 

1. *Billionaire*- Ive always been curious about the wealth distribution across countries, industries, companies and even individuals. Here is some descriptive graphs and indicators that I developed by using data published by Forbes about Billionaires at the end of 2022. In the same file you can find a page report presenting GDP data from 2021 according to WorldBank data and compare those numbers to get an interesting insight. Appearantly, if we sort countries by theiir GDP in ascending order and combine GDPs of first 165 countries we will get about $11.5 trillion which is approximately the same amount as 2490 billionaires' net wort together! 

2. *NBA visuals*-Using some historical data from NBA I created the interesting vizual about shots and distances in 2010 - 2018 period.

3. *Contoso_DAXexamples* - Data Analytics Expression is a powerful tool that can be used for more complex measures and calculated column. This project is developed using the "Contoso" sample data provided by microsoft and shows some of commonly used calculations with DAX
